## Phantoms for Optical, Ultrasound, and Acousto-Optic Devices

Openwater has developed several phantoms for use with our optical, ultrasound, and acousto-optic devices. These phantoms are designed to simulate the characteristics of interacting tissue, and have various formulations and mechanical configurations depending on the application. 

## Prerequisites and Usage
